# About Lab 7.5

For this lab assignment, I used LLM models: ChatGPT-4o, and Github’s Copilot. Both of these models helped me create some of the project this week, and both had their advantages and disadvantages. Chat was nice because it would tend to understand what I was asking a lot more than Copilot would. For example, when I asked ChatGPT about the best ways to incorporate Alpine.js, Alpine Fetch, and Tailwind into the project, it gave me a bunch of different solutions that I could try and incorporate into the project. Unfortunately for Copilot, it would only give me one way to do it, and that way actually popped up with some errors. ChatGPT tends to give more in depth answers than Copilot does, but Copilot has its own advantages too.


When using Chatgpt, obviously the LLM didn’t have access to all of the files that I was seeing, so it would tend to create its own files, and expect you to incorporate them into the project as a new file. However, Copilot was a little more adaptive in that sense. Copilot, at least in Microsoft Visual Studio, would show you what the code would look like in context. Copilot took the files that I had in the project, and would tell me where I should include them, give me a preview of what the code would look like, and an option to copy the code into the project. Overall, ChatGPT offered more of a variety of answers, but Copilot did a better job of showing you step by step how you can implement the solution it gives in context.
